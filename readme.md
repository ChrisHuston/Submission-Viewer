Submission Viewer
======
Choose from a list of assignments with submissions to display a list of all the submissions along with the student's name and date of submission. Buttons to preview or download the submissions. Preview will open a new window with a button for previewing the file. This preview via Canvas's Croc-o-doc will display any instructor or TA comments from SpeedGrader, but grades will not be visible.

Option to have students access the submissions for assignments marked as public. Students cannot preview, but can download submissions.
